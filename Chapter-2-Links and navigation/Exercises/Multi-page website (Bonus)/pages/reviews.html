        <p class="user-review">Absolutely the greatest solo hero film of all time! Iron man looks super cool with the classic red and gold
            highlights. The movie us an absolute classic in the MCU and is such a good movie that i can't stop
            re-watching it. The story is really great and how Tony famously crashed the mark 2 onto his Cobra oof.
            The fight scenes are just awesome with the mark 3 shooting rockets and the flying. This has to be
            the greatest movie and is definitely 1 of if not the best marvel movies ever.</p>
